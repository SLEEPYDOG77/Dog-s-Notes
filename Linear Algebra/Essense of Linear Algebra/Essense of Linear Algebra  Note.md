> "There is hardly any theory which is more elementary than linear algebra, in spite of the fact that generations of professors and textbook writers have obscured its simplicity by preposterous calculations with matrices. "

> —— `Jean Dieudonne`
>
> “尽管一批教授和教科书编者用关于矩阵的荒唐至极的计算内容掩盖了线性代数的简明性，但是鲜有与之相较更为初等的理论。”
