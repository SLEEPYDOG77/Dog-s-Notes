近些年，父母要求他们的孩子接受额外教育的现象呈增长的势头。

**There has been a growing tendency for** parents to ask their children to accept extra educational programs **over the recent years.**



这一现象在全世界许多地方已引起了广泛关注。

**This phenomenon has caused wide public concern in many places of the world.**



许多家长相信额外的教育活动有明显的优点。他们认为，通过学习，他们的孩子可以获得很多实践技能和有用的知识，当他们长大后，这些对他们就业是大有好处的。

**Many parents believe that** additional educational activities enjoy obvious advantages. By extra studies, they maintain, their children are able to **obtain many kinds of practical skills and useful knowledge, which will put them in a beneficial position in the future job markets when they grow up.**



首先，额外的学习对孩子们的身体发育是不利的。教育专家指出，孩子们在鼓噪的教室里待了一整天后，从事一些体育活动，而不是额外的学习，是非常重要的。

**In the first place**, extra studies **bring about unhealthy impacts on** physical growth of children. Educational **experts point out that, it is equally important to** take some sports activities **instead of** extra studies when children have spent the whole day in a boring classroom.



孩子们正处于身体快速发育时期，缺乏体育锻炼可能会对他们未来的生活造成严重的影响。

Children are **undergoing** fast physical development; **lack of** physical exercise may **produce a disastrous influence on** their later life.



第二，从心理上讲，大部分孩子似乎对额外的学习活动没有什么好感。

**In the second place**, **from the psychological aspect**, the majority of children seem to **have an unfavorable attitude toward** additional educational activities.



当别的孩子在玩耍的时候，很难想象一个学生能集中精力在课本上。

**It is hard to imagine** a student focusing his energy on textbooks while other children are playing.



而且，由于要额外的学习，孩子们没有多少时间和同龄的孩子玩耍和交流，因此很难培养他们的个性和交际能力。他们可能变得更孤僻甚至产生某些心理疾病。

**Moreover**, children will have less time to play and communicate with their peers **due to** extra studies. **Consequently**, **it is difficult to develop and cultivate their characters and interpersonal skills**. They may become more **solitary** and even suffer from certain mental illness.



通过以上讨论，我们可以得出结论：尽管额外学习的确有很多明显的优点，但它的缺点不可忽视，且远大于它的优点。因此，放学后强迫孩子额外学习是不合理的。

**From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw the conclusion that, **although extra studies **indeed enjoy many obvious advantages, its disadvantages shouldn't be ignored and far outweigh its advantages.** **It is absurd to** force children to take extra studies after school.



任何家长都应非常重视保持孩子学习与玩耍的平衡，正如那句老话：只工作，不玩耍，聪明的孩子会变傻。

Any parents should **place considerable emphasis on** their children to **keep the balance between play and study**. **As an old saying goes: all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.**



现在，父母留在家里照顾孩子而不愿过早返回工作岗位，这一现象正呈上升的趋势。

**There is a growing tendency for** parents **these days to** stay at home to look after their children **instead of** returning to work earlier.



父母们坚定地相信把孩子送到幼儿园对他们的成长不利。

Parents **are firmly convinced that**, so send their children to kindergartens or nursery schools will **have an unfavorable influence on** the growth of them.



然而，这一想法正遭受越来越多的专家的质疑，他们指出，孩子总是待在家里，和父母在一起，是不健康的。

However, this idea is now being questioned by more and more experts, who point out that it is unhealthy for children to always stay with their parents at home.



尽管父母能在他们孩子身上投入更多时间和精力，但是必须承认，与工作在幼儿园的专职教师相比，他们在如何管理教育孩子方面缺乏知识和经验。

**Although** parents would be able to **devote much more time and energy to** their children, **it must be admitted that**, they have less experience and knowledge about how to educate and supervise children, when **compared with** professional teachers working in kindergartens or nursery schools.



通过以上讨论，我们可以得出结论：尽管家长想亲自照看孩子的愿望是可以理解的，但是这样做的弊端远大于好处。

**From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw a conclusion that**, **although** the parents' desire to look after children by themselves **is understandable**, **its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.**



应该鼓励父母将他们的孩子送到幼儿园，这将对孩子、家庭、甚至整个社会产生深远的影响。

Parents **should be encouraged to** send their children to nursery schools, which will **bring about profound impacts on** children and families, and even **the society as a whole.**



只要一提起艺术和文化项目，一些政府领导就会兴奋不已。他们滔滔不绝地说着美丽的公园，城市中心漂亮的雕塑，还有满是稀世珍宝的艺术展览馆。他们认为在经济发展中，没有什么比这些艺术项目更重要了。

Many leaders of government always **go into raptures at the mere mention of** artistic and cultural projects. They are forever talking about the nice parks, the smart sculptures in the central city and the art galleries with various valuable rarities. **Nothing, they maintain, is more essential than** such projects **in the economic growth.**



这是真的吗？这些年我收集的信息让我相信这些文化、艺术项目并没有许多政府想象的那么重要。事实上，基础设施建设非常重要，应该放在首位。

**But is it really the case?** **The information I've collected over last few years leads me to believe that** artistic and cultural projects may be less useful than many governments think. **In fact**, basic infrastructure projects are **playing an extremely important role and should be given priority**.



那些赞成建设文化艺术项目的人认为文化环境会吸引更多的游客，这将给当地居民带来巨大的利益。一些人甚至把建设文化艺术项目与发展经济建设等同起来。

**Those who are in favor of** artistic and cultural projects **advocate that** cultural environment will attract more tourists, **which will bring huge profits to** local residents. **Some people even equate** the building of such projects **with** the improving of economic construction.



然后，很少有证据表明大公司愿意把巨额的资金投到一个连水电这些基础设施都不完善的地方去。

**Unfortunately, there is very little evidence that** big companies are willing to invest a huge sum of money in a place without sufficient basic projects, such as supplies of electricity and water.



通过以上讨论，我们有理由相信，在人们生活和经济发展方面，基础建设比艺术文化项目发挥更大的作用。

**From what has been discussed above, it would be reasonnable to believe that** basic projects **play a far more important role than** artistic and cultural projects in people's life and economic growth.



那些城市的规划者们如果忽视这一点，将会付出他们无法承受的代价。

**Those urban planners who are blind to this point will pay a heavy price which they cannot afford.**



农民进城打工正呈增长的趋势，这一问题在世界大部分城市中已引起普遍关注。

**There is a growint tendency these days** for many people who live in rural areas to come into and work in a city. **This problem has caused wide public concern in most cities all over the world.**



一项调查显示，许多民工认为在城市打工不仅有较高的收入，而且能学到一些新技术。

**An investigation shows that** many emigrants think that working in a city provides them with **not only** a higher salary **but also** the opportunity of learning new skills.



必须指出，农业的发展似乎赶不上农村人口的增加，并且仍有成千上万的农民过着缺衣少食的贫寒生活。

**It must be noted that** improvement in agriculture doesn't seem to be able to catch up with the increase in the population of rural areas and there are millions of peasants **who still live in a miserable life and have to face the dangers of exposure and starvation.**



尽管农民工对城市的经济发展做出了巨大贡献，然而他们也不可避免地带来了一些负面影响。

**Although** rural emigrants **contribute greatly to** the economic growth of the cities, they may **inevitably bring about many negative impacts.**



许多社会学家指出农民工正在给人口控制和社会治安带来压力。他们正在威胁着本已萧条的工作市场，他们恶化了交通和公共卫生状况。

**Many sociologists point out that** rural emigrants are **putting pressure on** population control and social order; that they are threatening to take already scarce city jobs; and that they have worsened traffic and public health problems.



建议政府应该努力减小正在拉大的城乡差距，应该划拨适当的资金提高农民的生活水平，应该邀请农业专家向农民介绍他们的经验、知识和信息，这些将直接有助于发展农村经济。

**It is suggested that governments ought to make efforts to reduce the increasing gap between cities and countryside. They ought to set aside an appropriate fund for improvement of the standard of peasants' life. They ought to invite some experts in agriculture to share their experience, information and knowledge with peasants, which will contribute directly to the economic growth of rural areas.**



总之，我们应理智考虑这一问题，重视农民的生活。任何政府忽视这一点都将付出巨大的代价。

**In conclusion, we must take into account this problem rationally and place more emphases on** peasants' life. **Any government that is blind to this point will pay a heavy price.**



尽管来自高校和研究院的许多专家坚持认为这是独立生活不可避免的一部分，越来越多的家长开始意识到包括教师和教育专家在内的人该认真对待这一问题。

**Although many experts from universities and institutes consistently maintain that it is an inevitable part of** an independent life, parents **in growing numbers are starting to realize that** people, including teachers and experts in education, **should pay considerable attention to this problem. **



我认为，首先应看看学生们在校园里可能遇到哪些问题。

**As for me, it is essential to know**, at first, what kinds of problems young students possibly would encounter on campus.



除了孤独这一明显的问题之外，我认为另一个困难是对校园环境的不熟悉。

**In addition to the obvious problem** —— loneliness, another major obstacle, in my opinion, is the alien environment of campus.



新生常常在校园迷路，不知道去宿舍或图书馆该怎么走。

**Freshmen** often get lost on campus; **fail to find the way to** the dormitory or library.



更重要的是，离开了家乡和父母，看不到任何熟悉的面孔，他们不得不忍受思家之苦，这可能会导致某些严重的精神疾病。

**Most important of all**, apart away from their hometown and parents, students couldn't catch sight of any familiar face and have to suffer from nostalgia, which can cause certain serious mental diseases.



首先，学校应提供更多的服务，帮助新生尽快适应新的生活。

**In the first place**, school authorities should provide far more services to help freshmen to get used to the new life as soon as possible.



高年级学生可以与新生一起分享他们的经历：如何克服遇到的困难，如何适应新的环境。

The senior and junior students could share their own experiences about how to overcome the difficulty they have ever met, how to adjust to the new environment with the new sudents.



同时，应该鼓励年轻人和他们的同龄人交往，发展他们的交际能力，这将帮助他们极大地减少对父母的依赖并保持健康的精神状态。

At the same time, young people should be encouraged to communicate with their peers and develop their interpersonal skills, which may help them greatly to reduce dependence on their parents and are essential in the maintenance of healthy mental conditon.



总之，我们应重视这个问题，尽最大努力帮助他们平稳度过他们最初的校园生活。



近些年，关于时尚存在着广泛的争论。其中一个问题就是一个人是否应选择他喜欢的舒适的衣服，而不管衣服是否时尚。



这一问题已被越来越多的人关注，尤其是父母和教育专家。



许多年轻人一提到买时尚服装就兴高采烈。他们似乎被时尚服装那多彩的面料、各种不同的款式所吸引。他们认为没有什么能与时尚服装相比。事实上，时尚服装已经变成了年轻人生活中不可或缺的一部分。



许多人似乎忽视了这个基本事实：衣服的基本功能是让我们保持舒适和温暖。



而且，沉湎于时尚服装的人们不得不花费更多时间逛商店，更加注意自己给别人的印象。因此，他们不可能有足够的时间和精力用于学习或工作。



没有人能否认这一重要事实：最近几年交通问题在全世界受到了普遍关注。越来越多的专家开始相信这种状况将对当地的经济发展产生不利影响。



关于这个问题，有很多原因。一个主要原因是车辆增加的速度远快于道路建设的速度。另一个主要原因是私家车过多而公交车不够。
